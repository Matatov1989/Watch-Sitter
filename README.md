# Watch Sitter #

The program sends alarm messages to selected contacts from the phone book, provided that within 5 minutes the alarm does not turn off.

The idea is that an active, healthy person is able to turn off the alarm, and an inactive person needs help.

For the full operation of the program need:
1. set a suitable alarm clock;
2. select one or several contacts to receive a SMS message;
